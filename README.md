# OverWatch Game Stats Database 📊

This project involves the creation of a **database** designed to store and manage statistics for the game **OverWatch**. The database holds information about user performance, ranks, characters, and maps, providing insights into a player's gameplay and in-game achievements.

## 📝 Project Overview

The database is designed to store OverWatch player statistics, including weapon accuracy, win rate, hours played, and Kill/Death/Assist (KDA) ratio. It also tracks ranks for each role a player performs (tank, damage, support, or flex), alongside information about OverWatch characters and maps.

## 🛠️ Functionalities

Through the system, users can:

- **View player statistics**: Retrieve a player's key performance metrics (e.g. weapon accuracy, win rate, hours played, KDA) by searching with their unique player ID.
- **View ranks by role**: Search by player ID to see their rank for each role—tank, damage, support, or flex.
- **Search characters**: Filter characters by their role, nationality, or special abilities.
- **Map information**: Check which game mode a map supports, its location, and whether the map has multiple instances or just one.

## 📊 ER and DER Diagrams

The repository includes **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams** and **Detailed Entity-Relationship (DER) diagrams**, which provide a structured view of the database model and its relationships.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **Database Management**: MySQL (or another RDBMS, if applicable)
- **Query Language**: SQL
- **Design Tools**: ER and DER diagrams for data modeling
